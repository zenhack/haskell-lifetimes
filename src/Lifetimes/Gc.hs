Module: Lifetimes.Gc
Description: Make resource-safe wrappers for values, with finalizers

This module wrappers for values to which finalizers can safely be
attached, without worrying that they may be collected early. It is
useful when the natural thing to attach a finalizer to is a simple
datatype.

From the docs for the 'Weak' type:

> WARNING: weak pointers to ordinary non-primitive Haskell types
> are particularly fragile, because the compiler is free to optimise
> away or duplicate the underlying data structure. Therefore
> attempting to place a finalizer on an ordinary Haskell type may
> well result in the finalizer running earlier than you expected.
>
> [...]
>
> Finalizers can be used reliably for types that are created
> explicitly and have identity, such as IORef and MVar. [...]

So instead, we provide a 'Cell' type, which:

* Wraps simple value
* Can be created and read inside STM, and
* May safely have finalizers, using the 'addFinalizer' function in
  this module.
* Ensures that the finalizers will not be run before any transaction that
  reads data is complete.

Note that it is *not* safe to use the primitives from "Sys.Mem.Weak" to
add finalizers.
